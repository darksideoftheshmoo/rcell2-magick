## Friendly reminders

- **Read the help page** of functions before using them. Open help pages with R's `?` (e.g. `?arguments`).
- **Read the README**.md at rcell2's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/darksideoftheshmoo/rcell2/).

## Prepare data

The examples here require microscopy images, already processed by Cell-ID,
Which are available in the `rcell2.examples` package.

### Image directory

First point R to the folder containing the images.

If you already have an appropriate dataset, specify the path to the images like this:

```{r}
# Location of your image set
data.dir <- "/path/to/your/data"
```

Otherwise, install and use the "examples" package:

```{r eval=F}
if(!requireNamespace("remotes")){
  # Install the "remotes" package if not found:
  install.packages("remotes")
}

if(!requireNamespace("rcell2.examples")){
  # Install the "rcell2.examples" package if not found:
  remotes::install_github("darksideoftheshmoo/rcell2.examples")
}

# List available datasets:
dir(system.file("extdata/sample_datasets/", package = "rcell2.examples"))
```

And get the path to the chosen example dataset, then use `dir` to check if the files are there:

```{r}
# Example: Choose one set of example images:
data.dir <- system.file("extdata/sample_datasets/sample_time_series/",
                        package = "rcell2.examples")

# List image files in the set:
dir(data.dir)
```

### Run Cell-ID

If using the example images, this step should be skipped. They have already been
processed by Cell-ID, to simplify this walkthrough.

A full description of the segmentation procedure foryour own images is available
in the notebook template of the `rcell2.cellid` package.

Execute the following to install the package and open the template:

```{r eval=F}
if(!requireNamespace("rcell2.cellid")) remotes::install_github("darksideoftheshmoo/rcell2-cellid")
rcell2.cellid::get_workflow_template_cellid()
```

### Load Cell-ID output

This section requires either the `rcell2` or the `rcell2.cellid` package.

You need only to point `load_cell_data` or `cell.load.alt` to the directory
where images and the Cell-ID output are located.

The following example loads the example dataset of the previous section.

```{r}
# Load Cell-ID's output
# cell_data <- rcell2::load_cell_data(data.dir)
cell_data <- rcell2.cellid::cell.load.alt(data.dir)

# Get the table with single-cell measurements
cdata <- cell_data$data

# Extract image paths and channels from cell.data
images <- cell_data$images
```

A full description of this procedure is available in the notebook template 
of the `rcell2` package.

Execute the following to install the package and open the template:

```{r eval=F}
if(!requireNamespace("rcell2.cellid")) remotes::install_github("darksideoftheshmoo/rcell2-cellid")
rcell2.cellid::get_workflow_template_cellid()
```

> Note: the "c" in "cdata" stands for _cell_ data.

### Load position metadata

This step is optional, but also part of our usual workflow.

The `pdata` CSV file holds information about how the cells
of each position (and time) were prepared and treated.

Get the path to the file:

```{r}
# pdata_path <- "path/to/your/pdata.csv"
pdata_path <- dir(data.dir, "pdata.csv", full.names = T)  # Sample pdata

pdata_path
```

Load "pdata":

```{r}
# It is a "metadata" dataframe we usually join to cdata by "position" and/or "t.frame",
# which contains other experimental variables: simuli concentrations, notes, etc.
pdata <- readr::read_csv(pdata_path)

pdata
```

> Note: the "p" in "pdata" stands for microscope _position_ data.

This table is usually joined to cdata by position (and time frame if available).

> Warning: `load_cell_data` does the following automatically if a pdata.csv file is found next to the images.
> If it were the case, you shouldn't run the join again.

```{r eval=F}
cdata <- left_join(cdata, pdata)
```

## Magick

Usage examples for the `rcell2.cellid` package.

Functions in this package rely extensively on the `magick` package,
an interface to the _ImageMagick_ library.

You must install ImageMagick in your system using your package-manager, 
or by following instructions available here:
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

### Simple usage examples

A simple `magick` example:

```{r}
# Make a mosaic with random cellids from cdata:
pics <- magickCell(cdata, images)
pics
```

Note: by default RStudio will display magick images in the viewer pane.
Use `magickForKnitr` (which wraps `knitr::include_graphics`) to preview the 
images in an Rmd notebook chunk:

```{r}
pics %>% magickForKnitr()
```

<!-- See: -->
<!-- * https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/11/07/magick-knitr/ -->
<!-- * https://github.com/ropensci/magick/issues/114 -->
<!-- * https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/2290 -->

Other simple `magick` examples:

```{r}
# Return single images (as magick image vector):
pics <- magickCell(cdata, images, 
           return_single_imgs = T)

pics %>% 
  magickForKnitr(format = "gif")
```


```{r}
# Use a custom function to modify images:
image_customize <- function(i){
  magick::image_annotate(i, "Yeasts!", "center", color = "gold2", size = "15")
}
```


```{r}
pics <- 
  magickCell(cdata, images, 
             customize_images = T,
             image_customize = image_customize
             )

pics %>% magickForKnitr()
```


```{r}
# List available channels
images$channel %>% unique()
```


```{r}
# Load two image channels, but customize them differently:
pics <- 
  magickCell(cdata, images, ch = c("BF.out", "yfp"),
             normalize_images = c(F, T),
             customize_images = c(T, F),
             image_customize = image_customize
  )

pics %>% magickForKnitr()
```

Missing frames in cdata can be drawn by guessing the cell's position based on its previous or later positions.
The missing frames are highlighted in red.

```{r}
# Load two image channels, but customize them differently:
pics <- 
  cdata |> filter(ucid == 40002) |> 
  magickCell(images, ch = c("BF.out", "yfp"),
             normalize_images = c(F, T), 
             
             # Fill missing frames in cdata.
             fill_cdata = T, 
             
             # Adjust how channels are stacked and images are returned.
             stack_vertical_first = T,
             return_single_imgs = T
  )

pics |> 
  magick::image_append() |> 
  magickForKnitr()
```

Certain frames can be highlighted automatically:

```{r}
# Load two image channels, but customize them differently:
pics <- 
  cdata |> 
  # Select a cell.
  filter(ucid == 40000) |> 
  magickCell(images, ch = c("BF.out", "yfp"),
             normalize_images = c(F, T), 
             
             # Highlight frames in yellow.
             highlight_fames = 1,             
             
             # Adjust how channels are stacked and images are returned.
             stack_vertical_first = T,
             return_single_imgs = T
  )

pics |> 
  magick::image_append() |> 
  magickForKnitr()
```

### Advanced functions

A strip:

You may manipulate "cdata" (filter, arrange, etc.) in the standard ways,
in order to produce strips for a single cell in time.

The strips are sorted by "t.frame" by default, but it can be overriden. 

```{r}
sample.ucid <- cdata$ucid %>% sample(1)

cdata %>% arrange(ucid, t.frame) %>% filter(ucid==sample.ucid) %>%
  cellStrip(images, 
            # Don't sort by time first
            time_colum = NULL,
            # Choose two channels
            channels = c("BF", "yfp.out"),
            # Normalize the first channel
            normalize_images = c(T,F)
            ) %>%
  # Include image in the notebook
  magickForKnitr()
```

Multiple strips (one per ucid):

```{r}
# Notice the plural in "cellStrips"
pics <- cellStrips(cdata, images, n_ucids = 10,
                   # Choose two channels
                   ch = c("BF", "yfp.out"),
                   # Normalize the first
                   normalize_images = c(T,F)
                   )

# Choose one
pics[[1]] %>% 
  # Display it inline in a Rmd notebook
  magickForKnitr()
```

Tiles:

```{r}
# First produce the images
magickCell(cdata, images,
           # ch = c("BF.out", "YFP.out"),  # Check out using multiple channels
           return_single_imgs = T) %>% 
  # Then build a "tile"
  square_tile(nCol = 9) %>%
  # Display it inline in a Rmd notebook
  magickForKnitr()
```

Make a nice 2D plot, showing random cells on each bin of the variable pair:

```{r}
pics <- 
  cellSpread(cdata, images, xvar = "a.tot", yvar = "el.p", 
             # Either set "for_plotting" to FALSE here, or select "pics$cell_tiles" later.
             for_plotting = F)

pics %>%
  magickForKnitr()
```

Make a 2D plot, binned by selected variables, displaying a sample cell in each 2D bin:

```{r}
plts <- cellSpreadPlot(cdata, images, xvar = "a.tot", yvar = "el.p",
                       x.cuts = 7,
                       y.cuts = 5)

# This is a ggplot object :)
plts$BF.out + ggtitle("This is a ggplot object!")
```

Fill missing frames. Inferred frames will have a red border.

```{r}
a_ucid_with_a_missing_frame = 40013

cdata |> 
  filter(ucid==a_ucid_with_a_missing_frame) |> 
  magickCell(images, 
             fill_cdata = TRUE, #min_frame = min(cdata$t.frame), max_frame = max(cdata$t.frame),
             return_single_imgs = T) |> 
  image_append()
```

Any set of frames can be highlighted with a yellow border:

```{r}
cdata |> 
  magickCell(images,
             highlight_fames = 2,
             return_single_imgs = T) |> 
  image_append()
```

### Exported utils

Add a border on only one side of the image:

```{r}
pic <- magickCell(cdata, images, 
                  return_single_imgs = T, 
                  n.cells = 1)

image_border_one(pic) %>%
  magickForKnitr()
```

> Useful to add titles!

## Shiny Apps

The package offers three R-Shiny apps to handle single-cell microscopy data:

* `shinyCell`: graphical filtering tool with image previws.
* `tagCell`: graphical cell annotation tool with image previws.
* `plotApp`: graphical filtering of the data in a ggplot object.

### Preview and filter: shinyCell

With this app, you may:

* plot cells and preview cell images by hovering,
* preview and/or filter cells with square areas (click and hold) or with custom polygons.

Construct polygons one point at a time, by double clicking the plot. A single click will erase the polygon.

Filtering logic is documented in the function's help page: `?shinyCell`.

> Note: oyu may want to test if Shiny works in your computer beforehand, using `shiny::runExample("01_hello")`.

```{r}
# Run the app!
result <- shinyCell(cdata, paths = images)
```

The final filter is added as a new `filter` column to cdata:

```{r}
# Devuelve cdata con una columna nueva "filter",
# que dice cuales celulas pasaron el filtrado (TRUE) y cuales no (FALSE).
table(result$cdata$filter)
```

Filters are named dataframes, and define each region as the points of a polygon.
They can be examined as follows:

```{r}
# List of dataframes with the coordinates of each drawn region,
# the associated variable names, and the filter logic "type".
names(result$filters)
result$filters[[1]]
```

The filters can be plotted using `plot_filters`:

```{r}
plots <- plot_filters(result)
```

Yuo can examine images of cells in each filter group with `filter_group_pics`:

```{r eval=F}
# Choose a few filters at a time
filter.subset <- result$filters[1]  # Only the first one in this case

# Sample cells from each one
pics <- filter_group_pics(cdata, images, filter.subset,
                          # Only sample 9 cells:
                          n.cells = 9)

# Append images of each filter vertically
pics %>% magick::image_append(stack = T) %>% 
  # Include the output in an Rmarkdown chunk
  magickForKnitr()
```

You can filter cdata by the `filter` column to remove the filtered cells:

```{r}
cdata.filtered <- result$cdata %>% filter(filter)

plots <- plot_filters(saved_data = 
                        list(cdata = cdata.filtered, 
                             filters = result$filters))
```

You can use `apply_filters` to reuse previous polygon lists on new cdata.

```{r}
result2 <- apply_filters(cdata,  # The new cdata would go here!
                         filters = result$filters)
```

Re-plot, updating the data on the scatterplot layer of the plot:

```{r}
# Update plots
lapply(plots, function(plt){
  plt$layers[[1]]$data <- result2
  return(plt)
})
```

### Annotate cell phenotypes: tagCell

This app will display the images of one time frame of a cell,
and provides a menu to "annotate" relevant charachteristics 
associated to it.

The menu is derived from the `cell_tags` arguments; a list that and defines the annotations and categories relevant to the user's dataset (see example below).

Below a variable from `cdata` is plotted against the available 
time frames for that cell. This plot is clickable, which is 
useful to navigate the time course of one cell. It also displays
any active annotations for the current cell.

At the bottom, a strip is shown for the current cell, sorted by time frame.
This strip is limited to a certain number of frames, and can be tuned with `max.frames`.

There are several options to tune image sizes, the plot, images channels, and so on.

```{r}
tags <- tagCell(cdata, paths = images,
                # Smaller main image view
                cell_resize = 200, 
                # Cell tags for the dataset
                cell_tags = list(
                  class = c("normal", "shmoo", "dead"),
                  type = c("cell", "ghost")
                ))

tags
```

### Plot and preview: plotApp

This app accepts a ggplot plot, and allows the user to filter the data,
based on a single rectangular selection.

Frist generate a plot:

```{r}
plt <- ggplot(cdata) + 
  geom_point(aes(xpos, ypos)) + 
  coord_equal()

plt
```

And then pass the plot to `plotApp`:

```{r}
selected.cdata <- plotApp(plt)

# Re-plot, overwriting original data in the plot.
plt %+% selected.cdata + 
  # Use the same axis limits.
  xlim(min(cdata$xpos), max(cdata$xpos)) +
  ylim(min(cdata$ypos), max(cdata$ypos))  
```

> A much simpler version of `shinyCell`, in a way.

## Extra

Experimental tools.

### Read a TIFFs section

Using "raster" or "terra" to read a range from TIFF files would improve the 
speed of theiamge handling significantly. However, this dependency is huge.

`raster` may be faster in some cases. Note that `rgeos` and `rgdal` [will be superseeded](https://r-spatial.org//r/2022/04/12/evolution.html) by other packages in late 2023. Both seem to use the same C library back-end.

Example using `raster``: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50851716

Read all TIFFs as a "stack":

```{r}
data.dir <- system.file("extdata/time_series_sample/", package = "rcell2.magick")
files <- dir(data.dir, pattern = "*.tif$", full.names = T)

rs.r <- raster::stack(files)
rs.t <- terra::rast(files)
```


Get the first:

```{r}
i.t <- rs.t[[1]]
files[1]
i.t
```

Get values for a square region:

* Read a block with starting corner at pixel 500:500, and size 200x200.

```{r}
# The raster way
vals.r <-
  as.matrix(raster::getValuesBlock(x = rs.r[[1]],
                                   row=500, nrows=200,
                                   col=500, ncols=200))
# The terra way
vals.t <- 
  terra::values(x = rs.t[[1]], 
                row=500, nrows=200,
                col=500, ncols=200)

# They are equivalent
all(vals.t == vals.r)

# Use one:
i.vals <- i.vals.t
```


```{r}
# This matrix is read as in ImageJ when transposed
i.mat1 <- matrix(i.vals, ncol = 200)
t(i.mat1)[1:10, 1:10]

# This matrix is read as in ImageJ "as is"
i.mat2 <- matrix(i.vals, ncol = 200, byrow = T)
i.mat2[1:10, 1:10]
```

Display the first matrix using `image`:

```{r}
# Display using "image", reversing the Y-axis so it shows as in ImageJ.
image(i.mat1, ylim = c(1,0))

# Equivalent, using an X-Y coordinate grid for each pixel,
# the matrix as values, and a reversed Y-axis once more.
image(x = 1:200, y = 1:200, z = i.mat1, ylim = c(200,1))
# The latter produces the more expected pixel coordinates.

# Using gray-scale:
image(x = 1:200, y = 1:200, z = i.mat1, ylim = c(200,1), col=gray.colors(n=max(i.vals)))
```

To display the first matrix using `image`, transpose it first:

```{r}
# Display using "image", reversing the Y-axis so it shows as in ImageJ.
image(t(i.mat2), ylim = c(1,0))

# Equivalent, using an X-Y coordinate grid for each pixel,
# the matrix as values, and a reversed Y-axis once more.
image(x = 1:200, y = 1:200, z = t(i.mat2), ylim = c(200,1))
# The latter produces the more expected pixel coordinates.

# Using gray-scale:
image(x = 1:200, y = 1:200, z = t(i.mat2), ylim = c(200,1), col=gray.colors(n=max(i.vals)))
```
