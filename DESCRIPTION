Description: Analyse cellID data in the tidyverse framework. This package also has utility functions to generate, filter and preview data 
    from fluorescence microscopy experiments (and maybe general cell cytometry).
    It is meant as a successor to the older RCell package.
    This package includes the CellID program source, and wraps it in a single R function.
    Also included are the tools to process CellID output (from tidyCell).
    Finally, a R-Shiny app will help users filter data graphically, with previews.
